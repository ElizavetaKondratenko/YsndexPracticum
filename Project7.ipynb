    "Прежде всего, большинство переменных в исходных данных представлены численными типами: `float64` и `int64`. Помимо этого в данных присутствуют три переменные с типом `object` - для дальнейшей работы необходимо решить, что мы будет с ними делать, ведь в таком виде они не подойдут для моделирования. Рассмотрим каждую из данных характеристик в отдельности. Первая такая переменная отвечает за фамилию клиента - данная характеристика не является информативной при моделировании по следующей возможной причине. Существует довольно много разнообразных фамилий и вычленить какую-то зависимость между ними и поведением клиентов на проводимом нами довольно базовом моделировании довльно сложно. Именно поэтому нами было принято решение удалить данную характеристику. К данному типу также относятся переменные, отвечающие за регион проживания и пол клиента. Обе переменные могут оказывать некоторое влияние на поведение клиента, поэтому довльно важно учесть данные характеристики при моделировании. Для этого мы закодируем их при помощи метода One-Hot Encoding. Поскольку у нас всего две исходные характеристики и они обе принимают не слишком большое число уникальных значений, созданием категориальных переменных мы не станим чрезмерно множить переменные. \n",
    "\n",
    "Также нельзя не заметить наличие пропусков у одной из характеристик - количество лет, в течении которых клиент пользовался услугами рассматриваемого нами банка. Наблюдения с пропусками автоматически исключаются при моделировании методами машинного обучения, поэтому, чтобы не потерять часть данных, нам предстоит пободрать оптимальный способ заполнения данных пропусков. \n",
    "\n",
    "Как уже упоминалось ранее, большинство исходных переменных представлены численными типами. Для того, чтобы не потерять потенциально значимые переменные из-за того, что они обладают меньшими значениями по сравнению с другими переменными, используем стандартизацию данных. \n",
    "\n",
    "Наконец, хотелось бы отметить еще один значимый момент. Мы уже упоминали, что фамилия не является информативным параметром для наших моделей и, помимо данной характеристики, есть еще несолько неиформативных переменных, которые бы не стоило учитывать при моделировании - порядковый номер клиента, а также его ID.

На втором этапе мы попытались учесть имеющийся дисбаланс: сменяли веса классов, увеличивали число наблюдений с положиетльными ответами.
